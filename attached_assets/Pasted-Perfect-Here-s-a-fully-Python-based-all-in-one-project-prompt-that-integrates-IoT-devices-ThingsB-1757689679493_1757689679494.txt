Perfect! Here‚Äôs a fully Python-based, all-in-one project prompt that integrates IoT devices, ThingsBoard, OpenAI API, AI recommendations, notifications, dashboards, and all features in one cohesive solution. I‚Äôve written it to emphasize Python-only, secure credentials, and 100% original code.

‚úÖ Final Project Prompt ‚Äì Python-Only Real-Time Energy Monitoring & Recommendation Platform
Project Title:

Neighborhood Energy Tracker ‚Äì Python-Powered Insights, Notifications & Sustainable Living

‚úÖ Core Objective

Build a fully Python-based application that:

Collects real-time energy data from IoT devices (ESP32, Raspberry Pi)

Provides AI-powered recommendations and forecasts using OpenAI API or custom ML models

Sends notifications for anomalies, peak usage, or sustainability tips

Maintains secure data storage and access via ThingsBoard CE

Generates dashboards and visualizations for households and neighborhoods

Gamifies energy saving via points, leaderboards, and rewards

The goal is to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform encouraging sustainable energy use.

‚úÖ Key Features & Solutions
üîã Real-Time Energy Monitoring

Collect live energy data via MQTT from ESP32/Raspberry Pi

Allow manual energy input for homes without sensors

AI interpolation to handle missing data

ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations

Analyze historical data to provide personalized suggestions

Use OpenAI API or Python ML libraries for forecasting consumption trends

Detect anomalies, energy leaks, or faulty devices

Generate daily, weekly, and monthly energy reports

üìä Dashboards & Visualizations

Build dashboards using Streamlit or Plotly Dash

Show real-time consumption, carbon footprint, historical trends

Display leaderboards for neighborhood energy savings

Interactive charts with alerts for peak consumption

üîî Notifications & Alerts

Send email, SMS, or in-app notifications when energy usage exceeds thresholds

Alert users of unusual patterns or device malfunctions

Push recommendations and tips dynamically from AI

üéÆ Gamification & Community

Assign points for energy-saving actions

Track leaderboards and monthly challenges

Redeem points for eco-friendly products or discounts

‚òÅ Secure Cloud & ThingsBoard Integration

Use ThingsBoard CE to store telemetry data

Secure MQTT communication with TLS and access tokens

Use .env files for ThingsBoard API, OpenAI key, MQTT credentials

Ensure all API keys are backend-only and never exposed

üîÑ Hybrid Data Collection

Combine sensor data and manual inputs

AI fills in gaps for continuous monitoring

‚úÖ Technical Requirements & Tech Stack (Python-Only)

Frontend / Dashboards:

Streamlit or Plotly Dash (Python-based GUI + visualization)

Backend & Data Processing:

Python 3.x

Flask / FastAPI for APIs (optional)

Pandas, NumPy for data processing

Scikit-learn / OpenAI API for AI insights

Paho-MQTT for IoT integration

IoT & Communication:

MQTT over TLS for ESP32/Raspberry Pi

ThingsBoard CE API for telemetry and dashboards

OpenAI API for recommendation generation and energy-saving tips

Database & Storage:

ThingsBoard DB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL

All credentials stored in .env files

Notifications:

SMTP / Email, Twilio SMS, or in-app alerts

Configurable thresholds for usage, anomalies, or rewards

‚úÖ Security Practices

All credentials in .env files

No API keys or tokens in frontend code

Encrypted MQTT and HTTPS communication

Strong authentication and access token management

‚úÖ Documentation

Step-by-step setup guide for IoT devices

Configure ThingsBoard, OpenAI API, and MQTT credentials

Example .env template without real keys

Instructions for dashboard setup, AI integration, and notifications

Diagrams, screenshots, and troubleshooting tips

‚úÖ Final Deliverables

Fully Python-based app (Streamlit/Plotly Dash GUI)

Real-time IoT energy monitoring

AI-generated recommendations and alerts

Notifications for anomalies, peak usage, and tips

Gamification & leaderboard system

Integration with ThingsBoard CE for telemetry

Complete documentation and .env template

100% original, plagiarism-free code

If you want, I can now create a ready-to-use Python template that includes:

MQTT + ThingsBoard integration

OpenAI API for recommendations

Streamlit dashboard with alerts

Notification system (email/SMS/in-app)

You would just plug in your API keys and access tokens and start running the platform immediately.
