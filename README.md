# âš¡ Energy Management Platform

Energy Management Platform is a Python-based web application that enables users to monitor, visualize, and analyze energy consumption data. It is built using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**, with optional integration to IoT platforms like **ThingsBoard** and communication protocols such as **MQTT**. This platform is ideal for both personal use and industrial applications, helping users make informed decisions to optimize energy usage.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

In today's world, energy consumption management plays a crucial role in reducing costs and environmental impact. This platform provides a user-friendly interface to:

âœ” Track energy usage in real-time  
âœ” Visualize consumption patterns with interactive graphs  
âœ” Analyze data using mathematical tools  
âœ” Detect anomalies and unusual spikes (future implementation)  
âœ” Integrate with IoT devices using MQTT and ThingsBoard  
âœ” Generate reports and insights for better decision-making

This tool is designed for homeowners, engineers, researchers, and developers working on smart energy solutions.

### Step 1 â€“ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritesh-gupta1430/Energy-management-platform.git
cd Energy-management-platform
```

### Step 2 â€“ Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Activate the environment:**

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```


**On Linux/MacOS:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3 â€“ Upgrade pip and Install Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 â€“ Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8500.



### ðŸ“¡ ThingsBoard & MQTT Integration (Optional)

You can enhance this platform by connecting it with IoT devices:

**ThingsBoard Setup**:

1. Create an account on ThingsBoard
2. Create devices like home1, home2, etc.
3. Get the Access Tokens for each device.
4. Add telemetry data for energy usage.

**MQTT Setup:**
1. Use MQTT to send data from devices to ThingsBoard or directly to this platform.
2. Configure MQTT client settings within the app to match your broker setup.
Note: These integrations allow real-time data collection and visualization.
